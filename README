This repository contains code for modelling the progress of an infection within a population when members of that population are exposed to one another in the retail setting.

The file main.R calls all other files in this repository, and contains the wrapper function MatrixResult along with an example use of the function.

The parameters MaskProb and UnsafeInteractions can be entered as vectors to give a clearer picture of the number of people who will become infected for different levels of mask-wearing (given as a proportion between 0 and 1) and rates of unsafe interaction (per hour, given as a positive number).

There are many other parameters to tune, both as inputs to the function and immediately within the definition of the function. These include:

-ServerMasks: Do servers wear masks? (True/False)
-ExtraSafety: Should extra safety (e.g. a screen) be in place at each counter for each server? (True/False)
-NumTotal: How many people can the shop draw upon to act as servers?
-NumStat: How many counters are there?
-IncubationTime: What is the (average) incubation time of the disease (in hours)?
-Multiple: Is the queue organised into multiple queues?
-NearestNeighbour: Can the infection only spread from people who are next to each other in the queue?
-Queue_Capacity: Total number of people who can wait/be served in the system of queues.

Other parameters are discussed in detail in main.R.
